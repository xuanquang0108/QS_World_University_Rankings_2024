# 🎓 QS World University Rankings 2024: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the QS World University Rankings 2024 dataset, covering **1,497 global universities**. The primary goal is to **determine the strongest factors influencing the Overall Score** and to construct a **customized Composite Score** metric to assist prospective international students in their selection process.

## Key Findings & Quantifiable Outcomes

The analysis provided clear quantitative insights into the university's performance metrics:

* **Factor Impact Analysis:** Identified the top factors influencing a university's Overall Score through correlation and visualization techniques (e.g., highlighting that Academic Reputation has a correlation of `r = 0.XX` with the final score).
* **Custom Metric Construction:** Developed a **Composite Score** based on **5 core criteria** (e.g., Academic Reputation, Faculty-Student Ratio, Citations per Faculty) to offer a data-backed recommendation system.
* **Data Scope:** Successfully processed and analyzed **over 10 unique variables** for each of the 1,497 institutions.
