# ðŸŽ“ QS World University Rankings 2024: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the QS World University Rankings 2024 dataset, covering **1,497 global universities**. The primary goal is to **determine the strongest factors influencing the Overall Score** and to construct a **customized Composite Score** metric to assist prospective international students in their selection process.
